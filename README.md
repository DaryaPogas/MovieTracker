üõ†MongoDB Setup Instructions (for Reviewers or First-Time Users)
To run this project locally, you need a working MongoDB connection. If you haven‚Äôt used MongoDB Atlas before, follow these steps:

1. Create a Free Cluster on MongoDB Atlas
Go to MongoDB Atlas and sign up or log in. https://account.mongodb.com/account/login
Create a free shared cluster.

2. Create a Database User
In the left sidebar, go to Database Access ‚Üí click Add New Database User.
Choose Username & Password.
Assign Read and Write privileges to any database.
Save the credentials (you will use them in the connection string).

3. Allow Network Access
Go to Network Access ‚Üí click Add IP Address.
Choose Allow from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for development purposes.

4. Create a Database (Optional)
In Clusters, click Browse Collections ‚Üí Create Database.
Name the database (e.g., movietracker) and add an initial collection (e.g., movies).

5. Get the Connection String
In your cluster, click Connect ‚Üí Connect your application.
Copy the connection string:

mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/<db-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace:
<username> and <password> with your database credentials
<db-name> with the name of your database (e.g., movietracker)

6. Create a .env File in the Backend

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_user>:<your_pass>@cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/<your_db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=<your_secure_jwt_secret>
JWT_LIFETIME=30d
You can generate a secure JWT secret using uuidgenerator.net.
